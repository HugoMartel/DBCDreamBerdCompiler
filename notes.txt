const const pi = 3.14!
print(pi === "pi")// Maybe




function regex:
fu?n?c?t?i?o?n?|un?c?t?i?o?n?|nc?t?i?o?n?|ct?i?o?n?|ti?o?n?|io?n?|on?|n

struct Variable
{
    std::wstring content;
    union Type type;
    int priority;
}


How to deal with uncertainty?
=> COIN FLIP using the filename as a seed for the random number generator
to make the output deterministic for a given file#line
BUT not deterministic for a given code

ex:
- if (MAYBE) => coinflip (seed = time(NULL))
- compiler can't choose between variable name and definition (?) => deterministic coin flip
